Wordpress Migration Tools
=========================

I’m migrating my Wordpress blog to a static site and creating an archive of the old posts (so I don’t break the Interwebs). Anything I make during the process, I’ll pop up here.

The bit that you will probably find most useful is the WordPress Export file parser (parse_wordpress_export.py). It’s just a generic parser for the WXR (WordPress eXtended Rss) format.

All this is heavily geared towards parsing my own export file but I am trying to keep the code somewhat generic in hopes that it might help someone else out there.
